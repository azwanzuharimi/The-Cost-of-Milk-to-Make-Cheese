# ## The cost of milk to make cheese
# <p>The Coronavirus outbreak has caused major economic disruption. The pandemic's impact on the tourism, travel, and hospitality industries has featured frequently in 2020 news reports, but the economic impact has not been isolated to these industries alone. </p>
# <p>The UK dairy industry is one such affected industry and has had to work together to address current market challenges and avoid milk waste. The industry can adapt to the temporary decrease in demand by identifying opportunities for processing the milk into storable products such as butter, cheese, and skimmed milk powder. </p>
# <p>The UK Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs has contracted your company to perform a detailed analysis of the UK dairy industry to help them understand the industry's value. </p>
# <p>Your team has divided the analysis project into several tasks. One of the tasks is to determine the value of the cheddar cheese industry. The revenue from cheese is much more than, for example, whole milk, but a kilogram of cheese requires almost ten liters of raw milk to make. Your first task is to determine the annual cost of milk needed to produce cheddar cheese over the past five years. </p>
# <p>You have been provided with three datasets. <em><strong>Please note that 1000 kg = 1 metric tonne.</strong></em></p>
